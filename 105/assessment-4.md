1.  After completing the first course, I would have to rate myself as a beginner or a basic person when it comes to coding in the javascript language. I have trouble remembering stuff well, however there is a good amount of information to look back on in the eloquent JavaScript book. There are quite a few things I need to work on for myself such as remembering the mainly used functions and expressions. The things that I am going to do differently during the next course, are mainly going to be focusing on smaller details and values because I have overlooked a lot of little mistakes when I was making code. This always consisted of putting semi colons or brackets in the wrong places. I have also had made mistakes by using capital letters instead of lowercase. So, I will focus on those main problems and try to correct them during the new course.
2.  Objects in Javascript according to Jacques are, " arbitrary collections of properties". An object is created with braces, like [], inside of the braces you can put different text in between commas which are called properties. These properties have things relating to them such as values and names. As far as my knowledge goes, while using objects, you can add, remove different options or steps. An array is like an object when it comes to being able to add or remove items or steps, however, arrays are more organized in pairs or collections. Arrays have indexes and can store other arrays inside them and even objects. In arrays each property has a number value in a list. Such as ["Transformation","wolf","Squirrel","Human"), Transformation would be the number 0 in the order followed by wolf being 1 and squirrel being 2. Arrays are basically creating lists of information within one variable such as type, while objects show the properties.

Example of Object                                           Example of an Array
```
let monday = {                                              ``` var Transformation ={
  GoodDay: false,                                               "Wolf",
  events: ["Transformation ", "Wolf", "Squirrel", "Human"]      "Human",
};                                                              "Squirrel"
console.log(Wolf);                                              };
// → false                                                      ```
console.log(Squirrel);
// → undefined
day1.wolf = false;
console.log(Squirrel);
// False
console.log(Human);
// False
```
3.  The author in my opinion seemed to focus on an object being more of a topic and an array being a subtopic. From what I read in the chapter, the author has most of his examples being inside of an array. Each array had their own properties. In the reading it also shows methods for an array and object. Both structures have parameters set to function properly. In the "Choose your own adventure" game, I could have used both objects and arrays to better enhance my game and allow more sufficient parameters to be set. In my game, I could have used an object to create a certain topic and use the properties to set the values of the subtopics. My game relied on having different options and choices that would give you different scenes, with an array I could have returned more options or choices to make the game have more of a flexible variety of gameplay. I could have set the first choice as the value 0, and continued going up my list to have each choice be defined and be able to add more efficient lines of code.
