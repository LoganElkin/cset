CSET 105
1. The most important pieces of information that I have learned this week are mainly based on Binary. I chose binary to be the most important thing I learned so far because it is the base of most coding and you use it in almost all programming languages. Computers operate in binary by performing calculations and storing data using only ones and zeros. All of the digits in binary are referred to as bits and represent true and false in boonlean logic. Binary numbers are important because they simplify the design of computers better than the decimal system. An example of the Binary number system would be 100101 which would actually be the decimal number 37. I believe this subject to be the most important thing I learned because it truly guides you through the basics of programming.

2. All programming languages high or low level have there on way of working through functions such as some may be purposely set to be flexible to all values and types such as JavaScript. Other languages are purely focused on specific functions or types. Programming oriented around objects have three main principles known as abstraction, encapsulation and inheritance. Abstraction is a process in which a programmer hides everything except for the relevant data about an object to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. High and low level languages use abstraction to make things more simple, however it may become frustrating. Making smoothies with a blender is a good example of abstraction. You need to know how to use your blender to make smoothies. You need to provide water or milk and fruit, switch it on and select the type of blend you want the smoothie to be. 

3. Ways that the flexibility of Javascript may help you consist of, JavaScript is fast because it can be run immediately within the client-side browser. JavaScript is unhindered by network calls to a backend server. JavaScript is relatively simple to learn atleast compared to other coding languages. JavaScript is used almost everywhere on the internet. JavaScript works nicely with different Programming languages and can be used in a large variety of applications. In the case of the flexibility getting in the way of what you are trying to do, it may give Javascript a problem or atleast complicate the process of writing cross-browser code. This is mainly caused by the browser not interpereting Javascript properly.
