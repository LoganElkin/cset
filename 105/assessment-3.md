1.  The pace that we were moving throughout the first week was quite fast mainly because most of the information was newer to me compared to other technologically advanced students. The amount of information that the EloquentJavascript book had was quite overwhelming for me. The second week was harder for me because I couldn't figure out any of the Chapter Exercises in the amount of time I would have liked to had finished them. The constant information that we learn each day proves to be difficult to remember each expression or function. Once I got to the third week, I started to have more fun with looking at the code and the errors I had occur. Some of the information started to become more fluent to me because I had been keeping tracking of which errors I had ran into with certain functions or expressions. The pace that we are currently moving through the program feels a little fast as of right now but not bad enough to the point that I start to fall behind. 
2.  I believe functions are useful tools to use for organizing large programs because they can be a solid backbone to a program and can be built onto. An example of functions being backbones with real life structures can look like something plain such as a foundation and walls. With functions, you can implement rules and input variables or expressions to help build your code to your liking or to the point that a program can run without flaws. A function can also run into errors because it has its own built in set of rules which can be used as an advantage once you learn which expressions and loops work best for the type of program you want to go with.
3.  The different types of scopes using the analogy of a zoo can consist of, Local scope, Global Scope, etc. A local scope are variables that are basically inside or within the function and cannot be used with anything else outside of the function. A Global scope are variables that are outside of all functions and can be used by everything else in the code. In a local scope, a function called Felines could contain the variables such as Lion, Tiger, Cheetah. These variables would be local to this specific function only and cannot be used in other functions outside of the scope. In a Global scope, A function will be declared outside of everything and can be labeled as "Animals". All other variables or expressions would be able to use this function because it is available to everything and not just set to work with certain things in a scope.
```
An example of a Local scope      |
```                              |
// code here cannot use zooname. |
function afunction() {.          |
var zooname = "The Zoo";.        |
// code here can use zooname.    |
```                              |

An example of Global scope        |
```                               |
var zooname = "The Zoo";          |
//code here can use zooname       |
function afunction() {            |
//code here can also use zooname  |
 ```                               |
